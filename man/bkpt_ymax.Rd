\title{Identify breakpoint location with Ymax}
\usage{
bkpt_ymax(watershed.df)
}
\arguments{
\item{watershed.df}{A dataframe of sites with ecological and hydrologic data}
}
\value{
Breakpoint value is returned
}
\description{
This applies the Ymax elfgen method. This approach treats the maximum observed species richness value as the breakpoint. This function begins by locating the point with the highest y-value in the full dataset, then utilizing the associated x-value as the breakpoint.

# We don't run this example by R CMD check, because it takes >10s

watershed.df <- elfdata('0208020104')
