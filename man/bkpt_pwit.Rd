\title{Identify breakpoint location with PWIT}
\usage{
bkpt_pwit(watershed.df, quantile, blo, bhi)
}
\arguments{
\item{watershed.df}{A dataframe of sites with ecological and hydrologic data}

\item{quantile}{Specified value for the quantile of interest - 0.95 refers to the 95th percentile}

\item{blo}{A "bound low" value, or the lower bound of the piecewise range}

\item{bhi}{A "bound high" value, or the upper bound of the piecewise range}
}
\value{
Breakpoint value is returned
}
\description{
This applies the Piecewise Iterative elfgen method. This approach uses an iterative algorithm to identify shifts in the relation between maximum richness and stream size. A user specifies a "quantile" for isolating an upper subset of the data. A user also identifies a bounding range between two x-values ("blo" = "bound low", "bhi" = "bound high") in which the upper subest of data is believed to contain a breakpoint. (Note: Small datasets may not contain a breakpoint)
